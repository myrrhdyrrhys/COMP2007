# COMP2007
Programming Languages (Year 3, Semester 2)

A unit I took that replaced COMP3003 (Software Engineering Concepts) since the Lecturer for that unit was unavailable at the time. This unit exposed me to many different programming languages that were unique either in the moment in programming language history that they represented and the capabilities of computers at the time (e.g. FORTRAN and Algol), or in their type of language and structures (e.g. functional, logical and object-oriented languages). This was quite interesting for me as I had really only worked with OO languages before. 

This repository contains the weekly programming work I had to complete, with one or more different languages introduced to us each week. The final assessment was an in-depth witten report on a language and its contributions.
